# UWNRG Controls Recruitment Fall 2018

Controls recruitment Fall 2018 is hosted on a separate React App, the main rationale being
that we can make it easier to code on our application.

### Development Instructions

1. Install `Node.js` and `npm` for your OS: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/uwnrg/controls-recruitment-f18`
3. Enter `controls-recruitment-f18` and run `npm install`
4. Start development server with `npm start`
5. Build production folder with `npm run build`

### Deployment Instructions

The app is deployed on Heroku. I (Jeff Niu) am currently hosting it under my account
(jeffniu22@gmail.com) under the name `uwnrg-controls-f18`.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push heroku master
```
